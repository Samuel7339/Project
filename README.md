# Drag & Drop with LocalStorage  

This project allows users to **drag and drop** elements between two groups. The positions of the items are saved in **localStorage**, so they persist even after refreshing the page.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Drag and drop** functionality between two groups  
- Positions are **saved in localStorage**  
- Elements remain in their last dropped position even after refreshing  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for drag-and-drop logic and `localStorage` handling  

## 🎮 How to Use  
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
2. Drag users between **Group 1** and **Group 2**.  
3. Refresh the page – the users will stay in their new locations!  

## 🔧 How It Works  
- When an item is dragged and dropped into a group, its position is **saved** in `localStorage`.  
- When the page loads, the script **retrieves** saved positions and restores them.  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Add a **"Reset"** button to clear positions  
- Allow adding/removing users dynamically  
- Support multiple groups
